  chrome issued update that requires allowing external application every time (send marker)
  switched use to Microsoft edge to resolve the problem
  Required jslint on .js code to run
  Note: In order to stop request to open tc.exe every time it is requested,
   open IE, attempt to run the script there (send marker) and uncheck box to require
    every time.

wsc109 090320

wsc117
  Getting data from Totalflow rs232 using serial adapter

wsc118
  Scrapped Totalflow rs232 comms. Only useful for periodic data (not fast polling
  Average time between tx and rx is 0.12 sec per register
  Will be useful for polling specific registers using Totalflow app.array.register format if needed
  Switching back to ethernet / .mrm files for fast polling Totalflow data until TCI toolkit workaround
    is complete for Linux
  Began work to allow strings in settings page
  Main purpose is to allow maintaining tflow ip address
  Changed format in kpv file to show data type: eg. {f}  float

  auto logout user after inactivity  
  added dp alarm when in sp mode
  added clear crystal alarm button

wsc130

wsc131
  send_marker sends temp now as well
  logging markers in db working

wsc132
  removed pccu_count stuff
  added ability to skip points
  full_test now performs hold commands and checks hold status

wsc133
  organize init kpv value in order
  switched to firefox - chromium requires approval for custom url protocol per instance
  fixed error with init kpv getting wrong data type
  
wsc134
  moved beam sensor code to analog_in.py for more reliable operation
    avoids problem of missed data from queue

wsc135
  added awaiting_good_data()
  added pressure_stabilized()

wsc136
  began incorporating logging
  cleaning up pid code ...

wsc137
